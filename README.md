# VSTextField
Dead simple drop-in subclass of UITextField with super easy numbers formatting.

## How to use it?
Just place the VSTextField file into your project, and replace your current UITextField with it. Then set:

```swift
textField.formattingPattern = "***ABC**-*-345-**"
```

All * will be replaced with a number. That's all :)
